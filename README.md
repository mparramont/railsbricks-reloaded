## Prerequisites

In order to use RailsBricks, you need the following:

* A nix-based OS. That can be any flavour of Linux or OS X
* Ruby (version 2.0+)
* Some knowledge of Rails (!)

## What about Windows?

**RailsBricks doesn't run out of the box on Windows**. Read the [Windows Installation Guide](http://railsbricks.net/windows) to know what to do. You will first need to install the [DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) as well as the [tzinfo-data](https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo-data) gem.

## Ruby support

RailsBricks generates Rails apps with support for the current major Ruby release (currently, 2.0.0) + the current point release and the previous one, for example 2.1.4 & 2.2.0. If you need to use another version of Ruby, you will have to manually edit the Gemfile after the app gets created and update the following line with your chosen version number:

`ruby '2.1.5'`

## Install

Like any other gem, you simply issue `gem install railsbricks`

**Notice:** If you still have RailsBricks 1.x installed, remove it manually *before* installing RailsBricks 3.x

## Usage

To create a new app, just type `rbricks --new` and follow the wizard.

You can read the documentation, see a video and go through the *Get Started* tutorial at [railsbricks.net](http://www.railsbricks.net)

## Contribute

You like RailsBricks and want to contribute to its development? Cool! You can do it in 2 ways:

* Fork the code and implement an awesome feature
* Found a bug or a quirk? Fix it!

**Important**: before working on a new feature, [contact me](http://railsbricks.net/contact) or [open an issue](https://github.com/nicoschuele/railsbricks/issues) on Github explaining what you'd like to implement. I'm trying to keep the maintenance of RailsBricks as easy and fast as possible so before accepting a feature or a PR, we need to make sure it will be maintained properly and within an appropriate timeframe.
